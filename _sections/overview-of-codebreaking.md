In the last section, we mostly took the perspective of Alice and Bob: we focused on how to encrypt and decrypt texts using a variety of ciphers. In this section, we take the perspective of Eve: we'll study how to break some of the ciphers we encountered above. This will include some interludes on probability theory, which will help us devise more clever codebreaking techniques. 

It's worth remarking at the outset that codebreaking is not an "exact science," in the sense that there isn't any codebreaking algorithm that guarantees producing the correct plaintext from the ciphertext in one shot without access to the key. Instead, the techniques help constrain the search for the correct ciphertext: we'll see how we can make *educated* guesses about what the key might be, but they will be *guesses* nonetheless, so there could be points where some guess you made was incorrect and you have to go back and make an alternative guess. Still, the guesswork is "educated enough" that the techniques work pretty well (especially in an age we can get computers to do some of the work for us), so most of the ciphers discussed above are no longer considered secure!

The only exception is the one-time pad, which, as we mentioned above, does have a very strong security property called "perfect secrecy." We'll return to this again at the end of this section.
